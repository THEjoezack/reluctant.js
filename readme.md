Reluctant js is the first engine/framework designed to make things easier for the PROGRAMMER.

Some finer points of the philosophy

No binding. Binding is stupid.
Sophisticated logging and debugging framework built in. Just open the console window!
It works in all real browsers - except probably IE.
Requires jquery, because, of course it does!
Everything is global, it's just easier that way.
Looking for unit tests? You won't find any here, we actually have work to do and besides, we already fixed all the bug.


How to use it:

1. Include at the top of the page.
2. Use it everyhere.
3. Open the js console in your browser to see all the logging framework in action
